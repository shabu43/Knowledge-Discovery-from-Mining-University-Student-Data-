Final Year Thesis(Bsc)
Abstract: The main objective of higher education institutions is to provide quality education to its students. One way to achieve highest level of quality in higher education system is by discovering knowledge for prediction regarding enrolment of students in a particular course, alienation of traditional classroom teaching model, prediction about students’ performance and so on. The knowledge is hidden among the educational data set and it is extractable through data mining techniques. Present paper is designed to justify the capabilities of data mining techniques in context of higher education by offering a data mining model for higher education system in the university. In this research, the classification task is used to evaluate student’s performance and as there are many approaches that are used for data classification. The student will also get the idea how to take the courses and what will better for them.
By this task we extract knowledge that describes students’ performance in end semester. It helps earlier in identifying the dropouts and students who need special attention and allow the teacher to provide appropriate advising/counseling.
